# Welcome! :smile:

### First of all, we are very thankful that you have decided to give us your precious time for this experiment and for filling our `pre-debugging survey`. That was mighty :sparkles:_swell_:sparkles: of you.

## Yeah, about this task, so here are the three links:
1. [Golang](https://repl.it/@VineetMakharia/KosherRuddyQuotes#main.go)
2. [Ruby](https://repl.it/@AnkitArvindArvi/lifeWithProblems#main.rb)
3. Julia: {Link need to be inserted here}

There are three bugs in each code. Can you catch 'em all?:muscle:

## Note

You need to share your screen, but you can keep your audio off and also use only chat for communicating. You may choose to not share your screen but then we will not be looking at the data given by you. At no point, will you be forced to do anything. You can decide to leave at any time or not participate at all and just be here. Just here to talk to someone during the pandemic? That is fine too. If you need any help:raising_hand:, we will be here.

If we lose contact at any point, do not worry! We will find a way to reach you.
