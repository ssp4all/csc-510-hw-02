# Hi! This is the ruby part of the code.


To run the file [updated as of 23rd August 2020]:
1. Copy the code and go to [this](https://repl.it) website.
2. Click on "Start Coding".
3. Choose Ruby and then click on "Create repl", an online IDE will open.
4. Paste the code there and click on "Run".

>P.S.: You may notice that for larger values, the site will be slow. We recommend signing in on the website, as it will increase the speed of program execution. Anyhow, the best method to run the program is by installing ruby on your device. If you have Ruby on your device, open terminal at the location of the file, and type `ruby life.rb`.
