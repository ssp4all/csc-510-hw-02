It is an interpreted and high-level language, which can be used for procedural and object-oriented programming. It is a server-side scripted language, similar to PERL.

## About the objective of the above code:

In each generation, cells may be alive or dead, given by 1 or 0 respectively. Now, if a cell is alive, then it needs only 2 or 3 cells around it to survive, else it dies. If 3 cells are in the vicinity of a dead cell, then it is born and is alive. This program is called `Game of Life`.
