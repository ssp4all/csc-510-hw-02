# CSC-510 Software Engineering-Group 12 (HW2)
Game of Life implementation in 
- Golang --> https://repl.it/@VineetMakharia/CelebratedDotingConstants#main.go
- Ruby --> https://repl.it/@AnkitArvindArvi/lifeWithProblems#main.rb
- Julia

You can simply click on the Repls link and execute the code right there!
No need to install anything on your machine! 
>Note: 
>1. If the code appears stuck, or no output is visible; you may edit the code a little (maybe add a space). What that will do, is that it will open code in an anonymous session and that seems to solve the problem.
>2. If the code seems slow, you may login. This increases the speed of execution.
